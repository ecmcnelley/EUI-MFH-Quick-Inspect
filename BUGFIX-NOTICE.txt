# 🔧 FIXED - Mobile CSS Issue Resolved

## Issue Fixed
The mobile CSS styles were appearing as visible text at the top of the page instead of being applied as styles.

## What Was Wrong
The mobile-specific CSS was accidentally inserted AFTER the closing `</style>` tag, causing it to display as plain text rather than being interpreted as CSS.

## What Was Fixed
✅ Moved all mobile CSS inside the `<style>` tag
✅ Mobile styles now properly applied
✅ CSS no longer visible as text
✅ All mobile optimizations now active

## Result
The app now displays correctly on mobile devices with:
- ✅ Proper responsive layouts
- ✅ Touch-optimized interface
- ✅ No visible CSS code
- ✅ All mobile features working
- ✅ Clean professional appearance
